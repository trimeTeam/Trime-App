### :scroll: Brief:
Re-design the onboarding flow of the current Trime-app and display a prototype of that design.


### :hourglass: Time spent:
4 weeks.


### :checkered_flag: Goals:
Learn more about SCRUM and agile methods, learn how to work in a team with developers and designers, learn something new and bring some sort of value to the client.


### :heavy_check_mark: Solution:
We decided to re-create the onboarding process for Trime to apply user flows similar to best practices in for example ecommerce. We therefore wanted the user to be able to see the app and booking-process without having to sign up before. The development team then created the prototype using React Native (a completely new field for us).
